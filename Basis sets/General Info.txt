	basistype.tbl --> list with properties of the basis sets: Hamiltonian, relativistic, contraction type, ...

Among the non-relativistic basis sets there is one that with ANO (atomic natural number) contraction type but just up to Zink (and HAS all the electrons):
	ANO-L --> https://gitlab.com/Molcas/OpenMolcas/-/blob/master/basis_library/ANO-L

There are some basis sets with W, Re and Ta basis sets with non-rel Hamiltonian, but with segmented contraction and with NOT all electrons!!
