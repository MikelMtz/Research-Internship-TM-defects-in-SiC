++ Length and velocity gauge comparison (spin-free states):
   --------------------------------------------------------

 --------------------------------------------------
 A comparison between the dipole oscillator strengths in 
 length and velocity gauge will be performed

 All dipole oscillator differences above the tolerance of   0.10000000000000001       will be printed 

 Due to basis set deficiency these oscillator may be problematic 

 The tolerance is defined as ABS(1-O_l/O_v) 
 O_l : dipole oscillator strength in length gauge
 O_p : dipole oscillator strength in velocity gauge

++ Length and velocity gauge comparison (SO states):

 --------------------------------------------------
 A comparison between the dipole oscillator strengths in 
 length and velocity gauge will be performed

 All dipole oscillator differences above the tolerance of   0.10000000000000001       will be printed 

 Due to basis set deficiency these oscillator may be problematic 

 The tolerance is defined as ABS(1-O_l/O_v) 
 O_l : dipole oscillator strength in length gauge
 O_p : dipole oscillator strength in velocity gauge
 --------------------------------------------------

  Problematic transitions have been found
